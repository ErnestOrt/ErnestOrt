### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I have an entrepreneurial mindset and a strong background in managing teams that have successfully delivered high-quality products. With over 3 years of experience in leadership roles, I have honed my skills in fostering collaboration, making tough decisions, and driving innovation within my teams. My technical expertise allows me to guide staff engineers in making strategic architectural decisions, and my ability to communicate effectively with various stakeholders demonstrates my strong written and verbal communication skills. I am passionate about creating inclusive work environments and have a proven track record of recruiting and developing exceptional engineering talent.

I have had the privilege of working with a wide spectrum of projects, businesses and technologies. I have also experienced first-hand the transition from data centers to the cloud, as well as from monoliths to microservices and the emergence of non-relational databases. I have been fortunate to be able to work with the four main backend development stacks: .NET, Java, JS and Python.

Outside the world of work, I have developed quite a few projects, most of them have been left behind, but I would like to highlight two of them:

> [Deafblind Monitoring Center][dmc]
>  
> A true voice of the deafblind situation in the world.
  
>[Trampoline][trampoline]
>
> An open source project, which helps admin Spring Boot-based services locally during your development phase.
>(Unix||Windows)&&(Maven||Gradle)

Ping me if you have an idea and want to build something! ğŸ¤“
