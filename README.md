### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Ernest here. Currently working as a Team Lead at Clarivate building [Cortellis Drug Discovery Intelligence][cddi].

I have had the privilege of working on a wide spectrum of projects, businesses and technologies. I have also experienced first-hand the transition from data centers to the cloud, as well as from monoliths to microservices and the emergence of non-relational databases. I have been fortunate to be able to work on the four main backend development stacks: .NET, Java, JS and Python.

Outside the world of work, I have developed quite a few projects, most of them have been left behind, but I would like to highlight two of them:

> [Deafblind Monitoring Center][dmc]
>  
> A true voice of the deafblind situation in the world.
  
>[Trampoline][trampoline]
>
> Trampoline is an open source project, which helps admin Spring Boot-based services locally during your development phase.
>(Unix||Windows)&&(Maven||Gradle)

Ping me if you have an idea and want to build something! ğŸ¤“
